'Feel guilty,' while associated with emotions possibly stemming from deceit, is more about an internal emotional state following deceit rather than during, making it less directly relevant to signs of lying.

This could be exemplified in situations like voicemail or mute functions during a call. The reason-elements supporting this are:\n- 'here_near': This may signify proximity without direct interaction, similar to overhearing a phone conversation.\n- 'use_correctly': Implies functionality that when a telephone is used with specific features, such as mute, the user can listen without being audible to others.\n- 'ab_intra': Latin for \"from within,\" possibly reflecting the internal settings or features of a telephone that allow for one-way auditory communication.\nThe other two reason-elements, 'playing_with_cat' and 'together', seem less relevant and might indicate some noise in the data or model's attention.", "why_not_choose": "- 'television' and 'radio': These devices inherently do not facilitate back-and-forth communication; they are designed for one-way transfer of information, making them unsuitable when the need is for a more interactive but controlled auditory exchange.\n- 'mouth': Primarily used for bidirectional communication and does not involve any technology-based control over being heard.\n- 'song': Is a form of expression typically meant to be heard by others, fundamentally opposite to the concept of hearing without being heard oneself.", "debugger_score": " - Faithfulness: 2\n - Completeness: 3\n - Accuracy: 3"}

'made' could indicate the purpose or the design intention of the AI, which might be geared towards expanding its knowledge base.\n2. 'continually' strongly supports continuous action, mirroring the ongoing learning process.\n3. 'seldom' doesn\u2019t directly contribute but might be considered as a contrasting aspect to highlight the persistence in 'continually.'\n4. 'dumbness' also seems to be a contrasting qualitative aspect that strengthens the notion of continuous learning by the AI in opposition to a state of lack of knowledge.\n5. 'metaproperty' might refer to the inherent characteristics of the AI related to its fundamental operational framework, which likely includes learning as a core feature.", "why_not_choose": "Other options like 'healing', 'better knowledge', 'enlightened', and 'change' were considered less likely because:\n- 'healing' is typically context-bound to medical or psychological contexts which are unrelated to the ongoing task of data analysis.\n- 'better knowledge' while closely related to learning, lacks the dynamic element of actively gaining new information, and is more static compared to \"learning more about.\"\n- 'enlightened' implies a state of achieving profound understanding or wisdom, which goes beyond the mere analytical processing of data.\n- 'change' is too broad and ambiguous relative to the specific activity described (\u201canalysing data\u201d), missing the direct tie to continuous learning and improvement.", "debugger_score": "- Faithfulness: 3\n- Completeness: 3\n- Accuracy: 4"}
